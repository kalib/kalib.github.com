Hey folks, what's up?!

*Just deployed Octopress for the first time...*

**I guess this is a chance to practice ruby and git at the same time...**

> Also a chance to practice the markdown "language"...

And what if I wanna update my [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.com) with yaourt?

Just type:

`yaourt -Syu`

or, if I wanna also check and update AUR packages...

`yaourt -Syu --aur`

That's it...
